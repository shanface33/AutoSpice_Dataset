# AutoSplice: A Text-prompt Manipulated Image Dataset for Media Forensics

The AutoSplice dataset was proposed in the CVPR Workshop on Media Forensics paper "AutoSplice: A Text-prompt Manipulated Image Dataset for Media Forensics", which leverages the DALL-E2 language-image model to automatically generate and splice
masked regions guided by a text prompt. It consists of 5,894 manipulated and authentic images.
